        <p id="intro">About one in seven persons in India suffers from mental disorders of varying severity, as per the data in 2017, with depression and anxiety disorders being the most common disorders affecting 45.7 million and 44.9 million people, respectively.. Additionally, about half of Indians will meet the criteria for a mental health condition at some point during their lifetime.Many people struggle with their conditions in silence. They donâ€™t know where to turn or how to ask for help, and they often feel afraid of rejection or potential consequences. This problem can result in numerous issues, including exacerbated mental health problems, severed family dynamics, lost productivity, financial distress.Treatment and medication play critical roles in tackling mental health issues. However, the importance and necessity of being properly educated on mental health cannot be overstated.Mental health education provides necessary awareness and resources for individuals and their loved ones. It helps break the stigma associated with mental health. Additionally, it can promote efforts for treatment and recovery.Thus it is our mission to encourage mental health education and for that we have created this chatbit can guide people in need for help and can educate them about mental health</p>
